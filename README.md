# Contact Form Solution

This is my solution to the Contact Form challenge from Frontend Mentor.  
The goal of the project was to build a responsive and accessible contact form with proper client-side validation.

## Features
- Responsive layout that works across all screen sizes  
- Client-side validation with clear error messages  
- Semantic and accessible HTML structure  
- Clean and maintainable CSS using the BEM methodology  
- Simple and readable JavaScript logic for form handling  

## What I Focused On
My main focus in this project was writing organized, readable code and building a form that behaves correctly in all states (empty, error, success).  
I also aimed to use BEM properly and keep the structure clean.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5** (semantic markup)  
- **CSS3** (BEM + custom properties)  
- **JavaScript** (validation + UI handling)
